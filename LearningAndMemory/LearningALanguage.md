     * Learn useful, high frequency words within relevant sentences. | Instead of learning the word for coffee, learn the sentence to order a coffee.
     * Language islands: E.g. Introducing yourself (name, where you are from, what you do) | At the restaurant (ordering food, asking for bill) | Your work | Your hobbies
     * Learn using LASR: Listening | Active recall | Shadowing | Reading
     * Beat the forgetting curve with spaced repetition of your new batch of 30, 50, 100 sentences: Day 1: 5-10 times spread over 3 sessions |
       Week 1: Revisit those sentences every day using LASR (especially active recall) | Weeks 2-4: Use LASR every 2-3 days (e.g. repeatedly
       listen while doing another activity) | Week 5+: Use LASR once or twice per week.
     * Comments section: Where to find sentences? AI | How to understand what I hear? Vocabulary + pronunciation + repetitive listening and shadowing |
