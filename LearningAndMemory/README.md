     * Summarise in the margin:
       + paragraph 1 in 1 sentence | paragraph 2 in 1 sentence
       + For paragraph 3 and beyond: summarise all previous paragraphs in 1 sentence AND the current paragraph in 1 sentence
     * Speed reading is a scam

   - Mistake: Theory overload
   - Fastest way to learn any skill is to learn more slowly
   - Only experiment with 1 or 2 things at the same time
   - Always balance your new skill with practice. The right balance is "when you can feel that things are becoming easier and faster
     without compromising accuracy and consistency"

1. [Cade McNiven | Optimizing Anki For Language Learning | 2021-2022](https://cademcniven.com/posts/20210410/)
   - The point of that [60 minute] interval isn't to test yourself on the card after 1 hour — it's to test yourself at the end of the session.
   - Micro-steps: For example, the first 4 steps in 0.08 0.16 0.32 0.64 5 1440
   - As you learn more words in your target language, it becomes increasingly easy to learn new ones. Microsteps are incredibly useful in the
     beginning when learning words is difficult, but once you get better they become unnecessary and just add extra reviews without much benefit.
   - Anki And Immersion Feed Off Each Other.. ***Go immerse***
