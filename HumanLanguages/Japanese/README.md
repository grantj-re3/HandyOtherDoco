## Long vowels, double consonants, v-sounds, etc.

1. [Coto Japanese Academy: Anna Deutsch | Pronunciation in Japan: Long Vowels and Double Consonants in Japanese | 2023-2025](https://cotoacademy.com/pronunciation-in-japan-long-vowels-and-double-consonants-in-japanese/)
   - What are Long Vowels? | How to Pronounce Long Vowels in Japanese | How to Write Long Vowels in Hiragana and Katakana | What are Double Consonants? |
     How Do I Write Double Consonants? | Why are these Important? | Practice, Practice, Practice | Conclusion
   - Kana beginning with t, s, k, p, or n (or any of these consonants with a diacritical mark) can be doubled.
     E.g. ぴ [pi] ⮕ っぴ [ppi] | そ [so] ⮕ っそ [sso] | グ [gu] ⮕ ッグ [ggu] | ぺ [pe] ⮕ ッぺ [ppe] | な [na] ⮕ んな [nna] | の [no] ⮕ んの [nno]
   - To extend the A, I, and U sounds:  add the same kana after the sound that is being made long (i.e. あ,い, and う)
   - To extend the E sound: えい (normal), ええ (exception) | To extend the O sound: おう (normal), おお (exception)
