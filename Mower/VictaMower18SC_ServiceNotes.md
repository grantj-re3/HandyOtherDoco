## Instructions

The lawn mower motor was running very rough, so initially I
wanted to confirm this could be fixed by changing the spark plug.


Overview

1. Confirm that replacing spark plug stops the motor running rough
   before spending time/money on other areas [mower upright]
1. Empty oil [mower tipped to one side]
1. Replace blades [mower tipped to one side]
1. Replace spark plug [mower upright]
1. Fill with oil [mower upright]
1. Replace air cleaner [mower upright]


Details

1. Start with minimum amount of fuel in the tank (just enough
   for testing spark plug below).

1. To prevent fuel leaking:
   - Unscrew petrol cap
   - Put clean plastic loosely over hole
   - Replace petrol cap

1. Confirm that spark plug fixes the engine "running rough".
   - Use feeler gauge to confirm RC12YC gap is about 0.030"
   - Insert new spark plug
   - Test
   - Put old spark plug back in

1. **For safety, disconnect the wire to the spark plug** before
   putting your hands anywhere near mower blades and moving parts.

1. Empty oil.
   - **WARNING**: For 4-stroke mowers, either tip the mower according
     to manufacturer's instructions or tip 90 degrees to the side where
     the air carburetor/air filter/spark plug will be on the high side.
   - For the Victa Super Catcher model:
     * Get a bowl to catch used oil (expect about half a litre be drained)
     * Remove oil cap
     * You might wish prop up the back wheel (and perhaps front wheel)
       with a brick to prevent the mower weight being on the
       cutting-height adjustment handle and to help empty more of the oil
     * Tip towards the side where the oil filler cap (or dipstick or sump)
       is located.

1. Remove mower cutting blades.
   - I used a 9/16" ring spanner and a 9/16" socket.
   - Remove blade disc. I had a lot of trouble removing blades without
     doing this step.
   - Put whole disc into vice. To avoid warping disc, secure it
     in the vice at one of the blade bolts.
   - If you cannot loosen bolts with ring spanner or socket (and
     WD40) consider hitting ring spanner **handle** with a hammer
     (but don't tell anyone)!
   - To remove the last blade, put back one of the old bolts.

1. Add new mower cutting blades.
   - Adding new blades is trivial, but ensure you put on the parts
     in the correct order and orientation. Consider adding
     WD40 to bolts.
   - Replace blade disc. Ensure you put on the parts in the correct
     order and orientation. Consider adding WD40 to bolts.

1. Replace old spark plug with new one. Connect spark plug wire.

1. Add oil as follows. 
   - Move mower to upright position.
   - Fill with oil (about 400-500ml) by:
     + Adding less than the expected amount
     + Check level with dipstick (you might need to wait for 5 minutes
       for the oil to drain from the dipstick/filling pipe)
     + Repeat the above until level is between dipstick markers
     + Run the mower for a minute or so.
     + Wait for 5 minutes. Check oil level again.

1. Replace air cleaner by:
   - Remove old air cleaner
   - Clean any dust/dirt from inside casing of air cleaner holder
   - Add new air cleaner
