# Claw (Saw) Putting Grip - Links


## Coaching

1. [Julian Mellor | The SAW GRIP stopped my YIPS after 30 years (video) | 2021](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3fHpaPm8P9M)

   - Excellent description detail and demo.
   - No closeups. Mostly swing and grip is viewed same camera angle.
   - Detail at 2m44s - 8m33s
   - He has only been cured of the yips for "not much more than a
     couple of weeks" (however he is still using the saw grip 6
     weeks after this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztBQlwhfKZs)
     so a couple of months after changing his grip)
   - Saw grip:
     * Right hand placed on the grip "sideways"
     * Club rests between thumb and index finger.
     * Right forearm movement is towards the target (gives stability).
   - I think the last 2 putts (starting at 9m08s) were also holed-out
     (but don't look like it because the hole is full of balls).

1. [Glen Haynes | How To Putt With The Claw Grip (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It1yp5cEoK8)

   - Excellent description detail and demo.
   - No closeups. Mostly swing and grip is viewed same camera angle.
   - Detail at 1m35s - 7m14
   - Includes a few grip variations.
   - Likens backswing to drawing back a pinball lever.

1. [Glen Haynes | Myth No.4 - Accelerate Through Putts (video) | 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSWC3_xv8Vc)

   - **How to do long or uphill putts (with claw grip)**
   - Read the text accompanying this video
   - Don't accelerate (or decelerate) through the hitting zone
   - Don't do a short backswing and long followthrough
   - Equal backswing and followthrough

1. [Neal Freeman | HOW TO PUTT WITH THE CLAW GRIP (video) | 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JiQAIiOP2Y)

   - Good closeup showing hand positions.
   - Left hand. Similar to usual grip:
     * Thumb extended down the flat part of the grip
     * All 4 fingers around the club (index finger is not extended down the length of the grip)
     * No cupping of left wrist
   - Right hand. Use gap between thumb and forefinger to guide putter face:
     * Make a U-shape between thumb and forefinger; palm faces your body; slide the grip into that gap
     * Base of right forefinger touches thumb of left hand
     * Grip runs from tip of pinky to base of forefinger (but you can experiment)
     * Right elbow points along the target line (away from the target)

   - Short analysis of which hand causes your "yips".
   - If right hand, then use saw/claw/pencil grip. Otherwise use an alternative grip (which I've never seen before).
   - Reasonable closeup detail re hand position.

1. [Shawn Clement | SAW CLAW PAINTBRUSH PUTTING GRIP (video) | 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93GIeKYXtX4)

   - Good description detail and demo.
   - No closeups. Swing and grip is viewed from a few camera angles.
   - Detail at 1m54s - 4m30s (discussion after this is about putter head being slightly above the ground)
