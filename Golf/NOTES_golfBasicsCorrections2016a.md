# Golf basics and corrections

The guidelines below are for me - a right handed golfer.

Some of the tips are to correct my faults so perhaps will not apply to
all golfers.

## Grip

- Left hand - top 2 knuckles visible (stronger grip).
- Right hand - "V" (between thumb & index finger) points to right shoulder
  (stronger grip).


## Arms

- Relexed right arm (not completely locked).
- Right arm closer to body than left arm.
- Left arm straight.

## Balance - stance

- Left-right ball position: Ball should be slightly left of mid-way
  between heels.
- Weight is between middle of foot and **heel**.
- Weight must **not** be towards toes.
- Stand closer to ball.
- Left heel must **not** leave the ground during swing (helps balance).

## The swing

### Down-swing and follow-through

- Rotate arms anticlockwise - similar to tennis top-spin.
- Do **not** swing across body (ie. not outside-to-in; not a "pull").
- Aim: Pick a spot on the ball-to-target line 1m in front of ball - aim your
  swing towards that spot. Help achieve this as follows.
  * Keeping right elbow close to body on down-swing.
  * Finish follow-through high.

### Finish

- At completion of swing, right foot must end with only toe touching
  the ground.
- Hold the high finish.
- Check balance and both feet (especially right toe) while holding
  the high-finish.
