   - Rotate wrists upwards; club shaft moves up; a very common omission
   - Rotate arms clockwise (left arm moves up); club shaft moves right so that handle is pointing to target
   - Rotate shouders perpendicular to spine; so club is in a good position to start down swing
   - Drill at 3m43s

1. [Monte Scheinblum | Golf swing takeaway (video) | 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-s99Jlq0Mc)

   - When left arm is horizontal (parallel to ground) left arm should be pointing along the target line
   - Drill at 2m22s;
     * 50 yard pitches (with 2 hands)
     * with alignment stick (about 30cm) in front of feet
     * where the top of the backswing is with left arm pointing along the target line (as described above)

1. [Monte Scheinblum | The Perfect Golf Shoulder Turn (video) | 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aee8zAlL6sA)

   - Shoulder turn perpendicular to spine.
   - Backswing: Right shoulder goes up; left shoulder goes down.
   - Left shoulder (via alignment stick) roughly pointing at golf ball near end of backswing.
   - Right shoulder (via alignment stick) roughly pointing at golf ball near end of follow through.
   - [5m13s] Tilt (top of spine) to your right at address and keep it during downswing. This helps bring the club head from the inside to the ball.
   - [6m17s - 6m36s and 7m37s - 7m51] This body move (with spine tilt) looks very powerful!


## Swing

1. [Rickard Strongert | Golf: Swing Instead Of Hit (video) | 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PZP2u2tegE)

   - Relax your muscles during the swing (just like a relaxed practice swing).
   - Tip 1: Maintain constant grip pressure during backswing, downswing and follow through.
   - Tip 2: After setup, breathe out at a constant rate as you swing.
     * Try with pitch shot (first)
     * Try with full swing (later)
   - Tip 3: Open your mouth slightly and keep it open throughout the swing. Don't bite/grind your teeth.
