   - Similar to Dr Kwon
   - Right shoulder does backstoke (not freestyle)
   - Spine moves to produce backswing/downswing. Spine angle is not constant.
   - What powers the swing? "**Left side of body** moving down and around" [together]
   - Build pattern first: Club stays out and away; body turns.
   - Then step drills
