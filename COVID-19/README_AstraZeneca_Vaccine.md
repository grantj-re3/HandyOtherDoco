# COVID-19 and AstraZeneca vaccine for over 50s in Australia

## Introduction

I am an over 50 year old living in Australia. Unless one has some speical medical condition:

- my cohort will receive an AstraZeneca vaccine or no vaccine
- we will not have a choice of Pfizer anytime soon (unlikely to be in the next 6-12 months)

To me, the big vaccine (life or death) questions are:

- Were corners cut during rapid approval process for AstraZeneca (or Pfizer) vaccine?
- What is the level of risk for over 50s taking AstraZeneca?

Less important (because it is not a question of life or death) is:

- What is the efficacy compared to Pfizer or influenza vaccines?

I've attempted to find answers to these questions (and others) in the references below. I've attempted to use trusted sources of information... but it depends whether you trust the same people and organisations as me! Since I am not a health expert I need to rely on others.

- I have attempted to use content from health officials, health academics, health professional bodies, health reporters and reporting organisations who use the similar experts.
- I have attempted to avoid content from non-experts, typically politicians or social media.
- I've also attempted to use recent information.


## Main points

Here I list what I feel are the important points from the references section.

- In Australia, our **vaccines have had the full approval process, not emergency authorisation** like in some countries. [17]
- In Australia, approved **vaccines cannot give you COVID-19.** [11]
- AstraZeneca is a very effective vaccine against COVID (better than shown by the initial clinical trials). [5]
- One study claims the **chance of blood clots (CVT) is 8-10 times higher if you get COVID compared to being given the AstraZeneca vaccine.** [13]
  In other words, if you think you'd rather take your chances with COVID rather than risk the AstraZeneca clots,
  you may be surprised to discover that the COVID blood clotting rate is higher than the AstraZeneca blood clotting rate!
- To date [23 May 2021] **the observed number of deaths reported after vaccination is actually less than the [before COVID?] expected number of deaths** [26]
- The risk of clots after taking Astra is around 1:100,000 - 1:200,000. [2, 16, 23]
- The risk of death due to clots after taking Astra is around 1:800,000 - 1:1,000,000. [10, 16]
- Hopefully the above risks are even lower in Australia because only those over 50 will be given AstraZeneca (initially at least).
- In Australia, over 50 year olds will probably not have the opportunity to take Pfizer or Moderna until the end of 2021 or later. [5]


## Future scenarios

To date, Australia has had very little community transmission of COVID compared to many other countries, however ...

- Australians are returning from overseas and many want international borders open over the next year or so.
- Australia's hotel quarantine is inadequate so we are at risk of COVID escaping into the community
  where most of us are vulnerable (as we haven't been infected yet).
- Newer COVID variants (particularly the Indian variant) spread more rapidly than the original variant.
- Potentially, we could experience exponential growth of COVID infections as seen in many other countries.
- If many of us wait and only decide to get vaccinated once there is a large outbreak, I imagine there may be more logistical difficulties:
  + very high ("panic") demand for the vaccine
  + slower throughput of people being vaccinated due to extra precautions needed during widespread transmission
  + additional strain on the health system and health workers because they would be dealing with COVID hospitalisations in addition to COVID vaccinations

So although no one can tell what the future holds, it appears:

- COVID is not going away
- it is unlikely we can contain COVID indefinitely with our current hotel quarantine systems, more contagious variants and more international arrivals
- it is unlikely that it can be managed in the long term without vaccines

   - [The frequency statistics are out of date.]
   - You should seek immediate medical attention if, [between day 4 and 20] following vaccination, you have any symptoms, such as:
     + a severe or persistent headache
     + blurred vision
     + shortness of breath
     + chest pain
     + leg swelling
     + persistent abdominal (stomach) pain

   - One of the aims of vaccination is to achieve “herd immunity”, which is when enough people are immunised to stop or slow the spread of the disease.
   - The threshold for COVID-19 [herd immunity] is still unknown but expert estimates range between 60 and 90 per cent.

   - [Why should over 50s take AstraZeneca vaccine now (May 2021)? Why not wait until Pfizer or Moderna is available?]
   - [Risk of spread in Australia]
     + People are coming back from overseas
     + We do not have adequate hotel quarantine
     + We are at continued risk of it escaping into the community
     + We only have had a fraction of Australians who have been infected with COVID-19 ... [hence] most of us are vulnerable
     + it's winter and people are indoors and there's potential for high spread
   - [Future]
     + eventually we will have vaccine passports for overseas travel.
     + whilst the government says that you'll be able to get Pfizer at the end of the year and there will be plenty of doses, we don't know that yet.
     + there's going to be a queue of people from 12 years to 50 years ... So if you are over 50, you are at the back of the queue for Pfizer and Moderna, behind people who are under 50, and quite rightly so because they are at higher risk of the Astra clotting.
   - [Lower risk of blood clots for over 50 years old]
     + the data from Finland, Norway, Germany is that it was around about one in 40,000, one in 50,000 doses that people under 50 were getting [blood clotting]
     + ... versus what looks like one in 87,000 [in Australia for over 50s]
   - [Efficacy - the ability to produce a desired result]
     + Both [Astra and Pfizer] protect against severe infection to almost 100%
     + any symptomatic infection with Astra is around about 85%, 12 weeks apart
     + [compared with old Astra info] ... 62% comes from the early trials where they gave it four weeks apart
     + Both [Astra and Pfizer] beat the influenza vaccine hands down. So they are really reasonably high performing vaccines.
   - [Opinion by Dr Norman Swan]
     + Yes, it would be great if all we had was Pfizer and we had millions and millions of doses and we could just get on with it the way the United States and Israel and the United Kingdom have, but we are not in that situation and I think that we've got to make the most of it.
   - [Astra vs Pfizer effectiveness against COVID variants]
     + it's likely that we will need boosters next year
     + with the Indian variant there's not a lot of evidence that Astra is any less effective than Pfizer, and people in Singapore were infected with the Indian variant having had Pfizer. They didn't get seriously ill, but they got some symptoms though.
     + from the early British studies that were just published a few days ago ... if you have Astra first and Pfizer second, you actually get a better antibody response than if you'd had two doses of Pfizer

   - The blood clots are rare but troubling in the younger age group who are more at risk of clotting
   - pre-print which has not undergone peer review [not yet verified by other experts]
   - problem lies in the entry of the adenovirus [a modified and harmless virus used as a delivery system for genetic instructions] into the nucleus of the cell rather than just the cellular fluid, where the virus normally makes proteins.
   - Inside the cell nucleus, parts of the spike protein splice or split apart. These become mutant protein pieces which float off into the body and can very rarely trigger blood clots, the scientists believe.
   - the vaccines can be redesigned to avoid the problem.

   - Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)
   - In Australia symptoms of TTS have occurred between 4 and 26 days post-vaccination
   - Overall the rate of TTS is estimated to be about 6 cases per million people vaccinated.
   - the rate is estimated to be higher (20-40 cases per million) in those under 50 years of age.
   - Comirnaty (Pfizer) vaccine is preferred in people who have a past history of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, given the similarities between these conditions [and] TTS.

   - Studies have suggested it may occur in approximately 4 - 6 people in every one million people in the 4-20 days after the first dose of vaccine. However, higher rates have been reported in Germany and some Scandinavian countries.
   - TTS can cause serious long term disability or death (with death occurring in approximately 25% of reported cases). [Implies 1 - 1.5 deaths per million people after the first dose of AstraZeneca.]
   - So far no specific biological risk factors or pre-existing medical conditions have been found to modify (i.e. increase or decrease) the risk of TTS occurring after AstraZeneca vaccine.
   - Comirnaty (the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine) does not appear to carry a risk of TTS. [Another study (NewsGP above) indicates otherwise.]
   - ATAGI respects a person’s choice to make an informed decision on whether to accept the risk of COVID-19 vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine.
   - In the context of the ongoing risk of COVID-19 in Australia, ATAGI considers that the benefit-to-risk balance is favourable for use of AstraZeneca vaccine in all older adult age groups.

   - None of the approved vaccines in Australia contain the live virus. This means they cannot give you COVID-19.

   - According to the findings, the incidence of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged 20–49 is 20 per million
   - That risk then halves to 10 per million for people aged in their 50s and 60s
   - and drops to about five per million for those 70 and over
   - ‘It’s hard for people to understand what that risk means to them when we just otherwise really seem to have a normal life,’ Associate Professor Hespe said. ‘Whereas we know medically that what we’re trying to do is prevent the awfulness that is happening overseas.’

   - cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)
   - [interesting graph showing CVT rates of 39/M for people with COVID vs 5/M for Astra vs 4/M for Pfizer vs 0.4/M people in general population]
   - around 39 in one million people with COVID are diagnosed with CVT
   - meaning people with coronavirus are between 8–10 times more likely to develop the blood clots than those who have been vaccinated against it

   - there have been more than 300 cases of TTS associated with coronavirus vaccines worldwide, including 287 occurrences with AstraZeneca, eight with Johnson & Johnson, 25 with Pfizer and five with Moderna.
   - in the US, where more than 180 million doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been administered, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says there have been zero cases of TTS reported.

   - he said there were 35 cases of serious blood clots with the vaccine made by Pfizer/BioNTech among 54 million doses given; five cases with the Moderna vaccine among 4 million Europeans dosed; and three cases, later updated to four, of blood clots with low platelet counts among 4.5 million people doses — apparently worldwide — with the vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson. That is the number the U.S. appears to have updated to six cases out of 6.8 million doses.

   - The top video says:
     + TTS affects 4-6 people per million vaccinations
     + Risk of blood clots after taking Astra Zeneca vaccine is about 1 in 200,000
     + Risk of dying after taking AstraZeneca vaccine is about 1 in 800,000
   - The video in the "Is it a rare side-effect?" section says "The risk of mortality from COVID is much greater than the risk of mortality from these [Astra Zeneca blood clotting] side-effects"
   - Women under the age of 65 have predominantly been impacted.
   - Instances of blood clotting is less likely in older groups, the data suggests.
   - For example, based on the UK reports, for those in their 60s and above ... By comparison, we know that for every person in that age bracket who develops a clot, another 70 will wind up in intensive care in a month from COVID-19 infections.
   - [What I would like to know for over 50s in Australia, is the rate of death due to an AstraZeneca clot vs the rate of death due to COVID. I suspect we roughly know the first value now (around 1:800,000 to 1:1,000,000) whereas the death rate due to COVID involves predicting the future!]

   - Why can't we just immunise the vulnerable and leave others to fight COVID with their immune systems?
     + If we do that, this virus will continue to spread, especially to those with weaker immune systems or who are vulnerable.
     + The key thing here is to not meet anyone with the virus, and the way to do that is through mass vaccination, so the virus will not have anywhere to travel.
     + If we have a lot of people who aren't vaccinated, the virus will just continue to spread and be a risk to our families and friends. We cannot afford to have it circulating at high levels in the community.
     + It sometimes seems okay to say "I don't mind if I get sick", but in my experience as a clinician who looks after people in intensive care, when others feel they might have passed on that infection to a person who ends up seriously ill in hospital, it's a terrible burden to bear.
     + The only way we can protect older people and the immunocompromised is to vaccinate.
     + even if every young person ... had a strong immune system, ... they could still suffer from COVID-19 — some people develop long COVID, and there is mortality in all age ranges, even if you have a strong immune system. We don't yet understand why some people get really bad COVID-19 symptoms and others don't.
   - Have approvals and testing been rushed through?
     + These vaccines have not been rushed through. They are faster because there have been absolutely no delays to getting funding.
     + at every stage there were people lining up to participate in trials.
     + It's really those two things that removed the usual waiting times. That's why what would previously take five years took one year.
     + In Australia, our vaccines have had the full approval process, not emergency authorisation like in some countries.
     + Current technology enables us to develop vaccines much faster than previously and through collaboration between researchers and industry we've been able to do this in record time.
     + In addition to new technology, we did things differently this time, running trials concurrently. Traditionally, we run the three phases of clinical trials one after the other
     + But we were able to run [trials] continuously in populations with large amounts of COVID disease, so it was faster to see if a vaccine truly worked.
     + This was an economic risk for manufacturers and governments but not a safety risk.
     + The threshold for approval for these vaccines in Australia has been no different for COVID than any other vaccine. They're going through as rigorous, if not more rigorous a process than usual, given the incredible scrutiny.
   - How do we know there won't be longer-term effects if we're testing short term?
     + More than 200 million doses of approved vaccines have also now been given worldwide and many doses have been of the two vaccines we're using in Australia. So far, we're not seeing longer-term side effects. [But later they did find the rare blood clotting issue!]
     + The only way we can be 100 per cent sure there are no long-term problems is to monitor long-term.

   - Exponential growth ... accelerates over time.
   - According to various epidemiological studies, without intervention the number of new Covid-19 cases doubles every three to four days, which was the reason that so many scientists advised rapid lockdowns to prevent the pandemic from spiralling out of control.
   - The researchers speculate that some of the graphical representations found in the media may have been counter-productive. It’s common for the number of infections to be presented on a “logarithmic scale” ... it means that exponential growth looks more linear than it really is ... In their view, simple numerical tables may actually be more powerful.

     + Precautions ... While no specific risk factors have yet been identified, current data from Europe suggest that the risk of TTS [blood clots] may be higher in younger adults compared to older adults... Very few cases have been reported from non-European countries despite extensive use of vaccine.
     + Safety information ... Very rare (< 1/10 000): ... Outside of clinical trials, a very rare syndrome of blood clotting ... has been reported around 4 to 20 days following vaccination. A causal relationship between the vaccine and the TTS is considered plausible although the biological mechanism is still being investigated.

   - To 23 May 2021, 3.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been given in Australia. In this period, the TGA has received 210 reports of deaths following immunisation – 109 have been reported for the Pfizer vaccine, 94 for the AstraZeneca vaccine. [The report does not show how many AstraZeneca doses were administered.]
   - (93%) were for people 65 years of age and over
   - Many of the deaths relate to elderly aged-care residents.
   - To date [23 May 2021] the observed number of deaths reported after vaccination is actually less than the [before COVID?] expected number of deaths. [Almost all of these were administered to vulnerable groups and those 50 or more years old.]
   - Each year in Australia, there are about ... 3050 [deaths from all causes] each week... two-thirds of these deaths were in people aged 75 years and over.
   - 94 % (852 of 910) of COVID-19 deaths in Australia have been in those aged 70 or over.
   - Apart from the **single Australian case in which death was linked to TTS**, COVID-19 vaccines have not been found to cause death.
   - This takes the total Australian reports of cases assessed as TTS following the AstraZeneca vaccine to 27 confirmed cases and six probable cases.
