# Herd immunity and COVID-19


## Main points

Here I list what I feel are the important points from the references section.

- Herd immunity is when most of a population is immune to an infectious disease and this provides indirect protection to those who are not immune to the disease.
- One of the aims of achieving herd immunity is to keep vulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated protected from the disease.
- Typically immunity comes from either being exposed to the disease or having a vaccine.
- Vaccines train our immune systems to create antibodies that fight the disease but without making us sick.
- It appears that people previously infected with COVID and people who have had a vaccine can be infected a second time.
- It is very unlikely that COVID will be eradicated.
- The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known, but estimates are 60-90%.
- Several factors may affect the herd immunity threshold incuding new variants, change in human behaviour and how much vaccines prevent transmission.
- Herd immunity should be thought of as a gradient rather than a single number.
- Even if we don't achieve herd immunity, the more people that are vaccinated:
  + those people are less likely to get sick, to go to the hospital, or die
  + those people are less likely to spread the virus, hence:
    * others will be less likely to get sick, to go to the hospital, or die
    * unvaccinated people will be more protected
    * [the less stress on the health system (e.g. availability of staff and beds in hospitals and other health care settings)]

   - What is herd immunity? When most of a population is immune to an infectious disease, this provides indirect protection - or population immunity (also called herd immunity or herd protection) - to those who are not immune to the disease.
   - How have we achieved herd immunity for other infectious diseases? ...
   - What will it take to achieve herd immunity with SARS-CoV-2? ...
     + we would need at least 70% of the population to be immune to keep the rate of infection down (“achieve herd immunity”) without restrictions on activities. But this level depends on many factors, including the infectiousness of the virus (variants can evolve that are more infectious) and how people interact with each other.
   - What are the possibilities for how herd immunity could play out? ...
     + The more people the virus infects, the more chances it has to mutate. This can increase transmission risk, decrease the effectiveness of vaccines, and make the pandemic harder to control in the long run.
     + The most likely outcome is somewhere in the middle of these extremes.
     + When infection rates fall, we may relax distancing measures - but this can lead to a rebound in infections as people interact with each other more closely. We then may need to re-implement these measures to bring infections down again.
   - Will we ever get to herd immunity? ...
     + Even then, it is very unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 will be eradicated; it will still likely infect children and others who have not been vaccinated, and we will likely need to update the vaccine and provide booster doses on some regular basis.

   - WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.
   - Vaccines train our immune systems to create proteins that fight disease, known as ‘antibodies’, just as would happen when we are exposed to a disease but – crucially – vaccines work without making us sick.
   - One of the aims with working towards herd immunity is to keep vulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated (e.g. due to health conditions like allergic reactions to the vaccine) safe and protected from the disease.
   - The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known.
   - Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks...
   - There have also been reports of people infected with COVID-19 for a second time.
   - Although older people and those with underlying conditions are most at risk of severe disease and death, they are not the only ones at risk.
   - We are only beginning to understand the long-term health impacts among people who have had COVID-19, including what is being described as ‘Long COVID.’
   - What is WHO’s position on ‘lockdowns’ as a way of fighting COVID-19?
     + ‘lockdowns’, can slow COVID‑19 transmission by limiting contact between people.
     + these measures can have a profound negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies by bringing social and economic life to a near stop.
     + Such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded and under resourced settings, and depend on daily labour for subsistence.

   - It’s unclear whether vaccines prevent transmission ...
   - Vaccine roll-out is uneven ...
     + [Interesting graph showing Disparities in distribution by country vs early estimates for herd immunity threshold.]
     + In the United States, for example, 24% of people are under 18 years old (according to 2010 census data). If most under-18s can’t receive the vaccine, 100% of over-18s will have to be vaccinated to reach 76% immunity in the population.
   - New variants change the herd-immunity equation ...
     + the slowdown of COVID-19 in the city of Manaus [Brazil] between May and October might have been attributable to herd-immunity effects
     + but in January Manaus saw a huge resurgence in cases
     + In January, 100% of the cases in Manaus were caused by P.1 [variant]
   - Immunity might not last forever ...
     + It will also be important to understand how long vaccine-based immunity lasts, and whether boosters are necessary over time... COVID-19 could become like the flu.
   - Vaccines might change human behaviour ...
     + Imagine that a vaccine offers 90% protection: “If before the vaccine you met at most one person, and now with vaccines you meet ten people, you’re back to square one.”
     + But it’s going to be hard to stop people reverting to pre-pandemic behaviour.
     + The herd-immunity threshold is “not a ‘we’re safe’ threshold, it’s a ‘we’re safer’ threshold”
     + Even after the threshold has been passed, isolated outbreaks will still occur.
     + The vaccine is “an absolutely astonishing development”, but it’s unlikely to completely halt the spread, so we need to think of how we can live with the virus
     + Even without herd immunity, the ability to vaccinate vulnerable people seems to be reducing hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19.

   - Amid a swirl of misinformation, distribution issues, and legitimate hesitancy, as of June 3, only 51 percent of Americans have received at least one shot, and just 41 percent are fully vaccinated.
   - What herd immunity thresholds get you is more sustainable, more long-term control of the outbreak
   - likens the herd immunity threshold to a weather forecaster reporting on a nationwide average temperature rather than local conditions... wherever the pockets of people are that are not protected, there will be flare-ups in infections. It’s just a question of how long it takes for them to happen.
   - We have to be careful not to interpret the absence of cases right now as meaning that we’re protected.
   - As long as the virus is allowed to circulate anywhere ... it poses a threat to the immunocompromised and others who can’t get vaccines. It also has the potential to give rise to variants that evade the vaccines.
   - herd immunity should be thought of as a gradient rather than a single number: As more people get vaccinated, the entire population is better protected.
   - “We all want to see infection rates go down, but we want to see the deaths go down first and more sharply” ... [USA] Nationwide deaths are down from an average of more than 3,500 per day to about 500.
   - [Even] vaccinating 50 to 70 percent of the population with a vaccine that’s 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 will go a long way... “It’ll still find them, but it’ll be slower. And the ... more people vaccinated, the more protected unvaccinated people will be.”

   - While COVID-19 vaccines are very good ... at preventing disease, they are still unlikely to be good enough against transmission of the virus, which is key to herd immunity.
   - The role of COVID-19 vaccines may ultimately be more akin to that of the flu shot: reducing hospitalizations and deaths by mitigating the disease’s severity.
   - The COVID-19 vaccines as a whole are excellent at preventing severe disease
   - Right now, wealthy countries have largely bought out the vaccine supply... Rampant spread in unvaccinated countries may very well seed new variants that come back to cause new outbreaks in vaccinated countries.
   - There are four important thresholds, from easiest to hardest to achieve: protection against severe symptoms, protection against any symptoms, protection against transmission, and protection against infection.
   - In the long term, immunity in general tends to wane, with protection against severe disease being the most durable.
   - Even if the herd-immunity threshold is not reached, every additional person vaccinated is a person who would generally be spreading less virus than if they were not vaccinated. A person exposed to less virus is also a person less likely to get sick, to go to the hospital, or to die.

But if we’re all vaccinated, we’ll be safe from the worst | 4 May 2021](https://theconversation.com/we-may-never-achieve-long-term-global-herd-immunity-for-covid-but-if-were-all-vaccinated-well-be-safe-from-the-worst-159821)

   - But it’s still very uncertain whether long-term, global herd immunity is achievable.
   - Vaccines are the ultimate path to long-term immunity
   - The coronavirus will probably never be eliminated
   - Even if we overcome vaccine hesitancy and global inaction, and we immunise most of the world, we may not be protected against the virus forever.
   - We [in Australia] have virtually no local COVID-19 transmission... However, we probably can’t maintain this level of vigilance forever.
   - Even so, getting vaccinated enormously reduces your risk of severe outcomes like hospitalisation and death.
