# How an elderly/infirm person can get up after a fall

The methods below include those with a helper or by using objects such as a chair.
Since there are many situations where someone may fall, not all of the scenarios
will be suitable for your circumstances.

The aim of this page is to provide *lots of ideas* - hopefully some will be helpful.

Many of the videos/pages below include information about safety, checking for injury
and mention that the information is not medical advice. Although I have sometimes
skipped this content because it is repetitive, I recommend you watch/read several
pages where it is covered to understand these important facts.


## Two-chair method

The two-chair method uses one as a prop for the hands (or elbows) and a separate one to sit on at the end.

1. [AgingCare - Anne-Marie Botek | How to Safely Pick a Loved One (or Yourself) Up After a Fall | 2014-2021](https://www.agingcare.com/articles/pick-up-a-senior-after-a-fall-170447.htm)
   - For a quick review, start at step 6
   - If the person who fell doesn't have adequate arm strength, consider changing step 8
     so they place their *elbows* on the seat (rather than their hands)

## Single-chair method

The single-chair method uses the same chair as a prop for the hands and to sit on at the end.
Hence it usually involves turning before, or in the process of, sitting.

1. [CAREGIVERSTRAINING | Elderly Falls - How to get seniors back up from a fall (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99GnNHk71Qw&t=1m36s)
   - The first scenario assumes you are not injured and are strong enough to get up
   - The second scenario assumes you are injured and cannot get up... and a bunch of other things

1. [Fall Recovery for Seniors (BEST TECHNIQUE!) (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snb_1xZi5v0&t=3m36s)
   - Interesting method of sliding onto a chair (i.e. the "chair slide technique")
   - I suspect you could also do this while leaning on the chair with your *elbow* (instead of your hands)
   - This is an excerpt of a 52 minute video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIxywwJl-hc&t=11m48s)
     showing many ideas for getting up from the floor

1. [Kimberly Berg | How To Safely Help Someone With Parkinsonâ€™s Get Up After A Fall (video) | 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXkv_ODqDgY)
   - This video has fairly poor audio and no English subtitles
   - The carer requires very little effort
   - When the person first puts his weight on the chair, he leans on his
     elbows (not his hands)
   - You could probably combine this with the chair slide technique above


## Wheelchair method (i.e. Dependent Uprighting)

1. [Craig Hospital | Dependent Uprighting: Manual Chair with One Person Assisting | 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuqMfyjE2Zc)
   - The person in the wheelchair needs flexibility and upper body strength
   - The carer needs either strength or adequate body weight to counter balance the weight of the person being lifted
   - *Warning*: I suspect it is important that you ensure the wheelchair rotates from the starting position to beyond the
     center of gravity, otherwise the occupant of the wheelchair may drop back to the floor perhaps resulting in
     injury

1. [Knee Replacement Therapists - Dr. Luke Pedersen | Getting Up From The Floor After Falling - Knee Replacement Surgery | 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tUG4mDP6ac)
   - Lots of excellent ideas
   - Since the target audience is people with a knee replacement, some ideas
     assume the person is young and strong

1. Gait belt
   - Some of the links on this page suggest assisting the person who has fallen by
     holding their clothing or belt. An alternative option would be to use a
     [gait belt](https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/FallsPreventionCommittee/UsingAGaitBelt.pdf).

1. Step stools
   - Some of the links on this page suggest the person who has fallen use
     intermediate steps in the process of getting up from the floor and onto
     a chair or couch. Provided that steps will support the person's weight,
     you could consider using a light and portable plastic step-stool.
   - These are available in one-step and two-step versions.
   - The product details will often specify the maximum permitted weight
     e.g. 80kg.
