# How an elderly/infirm person can get up after a fall

The methods below include those with a helper or by using objects such as a chair.
Since there are many situations where someone may fall, not all of the scenarios
will be suitable for your circumstances.

The aim of this page is to provide *lots of ideas* - hopefully some will be helpful.

Many of the videos/pages below include information about safety, checking for injury
and mention that the information is not medical advice. Although I have sometimes
skipped this content because it is repetitive, I recommend you watch/read several
pages where it is covered to understand these important facts.


## Two-chair method

The two-chair method uses one as a prop for the hands (or elbows) and a separate one to sit on at the end.

   - For a quick review, start at step 6
   - If the person who fell doesn't have adequate arm strength, consider changing step 8
     so they place their *elbows* on the seat (rather than their hands)

## Single-chair method

The single-chair method uses the same chair as a prop for the hands and to sit on at the end.
Hence it usually involves turning before, or in the process of, sitting.

   - This video has fairly poor audio and no English subtitles
   - The carer requires little effort
   - When the person first puts his weight on the chair, he leans on his
     elbows (not his hands)

1. [CAREGIVERSTRAINING | Elderly Falls - How to get seniors back up from a fall (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99GnNHk71Qw&t=1m36s)
   - The first scenario assumes you are not injured and are strong enough to get up
   - The second scenario assumes you are injured and cannot get up... and a bunch of other things

1. [Fall Recovery for Seniors (BEST TECHNIQUE!) (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snb_1xZi5v0&t=3m36s)
   - Interesting method of sliding onto a kitchen chair or folding chair (but not an armchair)
   - I suspect you could also do this while leaning on the chair with your *elbow* (instead of your hands)
