Some of the links below contain material or advice which conflicts with content at other links.
However, I have attempted to only provide information from health experts (osteoporosis organisations,
researchers, doctors, physical therapists, etc.) and authors who support their information with evidence.

   - Introduction: ... the bone is responsive to mechanical loading, which acts on the bones through both muscle
     forces and ground reaction forces ... These forces increase both bone mineral density and strength
   - The aim of the review is to update our understanding of the roles of exercise ... with an emphasis on ... bone mass, bone strength ...
   - Conclusion: Exercise increases bone mineral density, bone mass, bone strength, and bone mechanical properties.


## Can Bone Mineral Density (BMD) loss be reversed?

I feel that most experts agree that BMD loss can be reversed in some cases with a
combination of treatments such as drugs, supplements, exercise, diet and other lifestyle
factors. However, it appears most experts feel there is insufficient evidence that the
reversal is adequate to move from osteoporosis to a healthy bone density/quality.

   - Debunking the Myth of Full Reversibility | Medication and Pharmaceuticals - A Double-Edged Sword |
     Exploring New Approaches - Exercise and Osteogenic Loading | Conclusion
   - Many individuals utilizing osteogenic loading have seen their bone density improve. It has gone from osteoporosis
     to osteopenia (low bone density) and in some cases even improve all the way to having healthy bone density.

   - 3m09s: some of that evidence shows benefits from some types of exercise but not from other types of exercise.
     I think an important thing to bear in mind is that the studies haven't shown the exercise alone is going
     to take you from being osteoporotic, having an osteoporotic BMD right up to being normal. So it can have
     a benefit, but a modest benefit for some types of exercise.
   - 4m55s: if you're inactive, you're likely to lose bone and by increasing the activity then some types
     of exercise can increase the bone density.

# Osteoporosis and playing golf

The two most common views are *avoid playing golf* and *modify your swing and behaviour* while playing golf.

   - At 0m59s-1m42s he claims people can be too conservative and avoid exercise to *prevent fractures* at the expense of performing exercise which *reverses osteoporosis*
   - At 6m18s-7m27s he discusses golf

   - ... golf may improve bone density of the lower spine in people taking hormone replacement therapy (Eser, 2008) [see Eser link below]
   - the twisting, bending, and reaching common in [golf] can put added pressure on the spine and could lead to a spinal fracture or
     fracture in other bones if proper body mechanics are not utilized

     strength and your balance and coordination and reduce your risk of falling*

       *We support the recommendation of weight-bearing exercises for patients with osteoporosis; however, the type of weight-bearing exercise ...
       must be critically evaluated before participation is begun. Specifically, studies are needed ... In the interim, physicians may want to
       caution patients with osteoporosis about playing golf.*
