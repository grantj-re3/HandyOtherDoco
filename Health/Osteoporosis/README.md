## Can Bone Mineral Density (BMD) loss be reversed?

I feel that most experts agree that BMD loss can be reversed (depending on the situation) but there is some
disagreement as to whether the reversal is enough to move from osteoporosis to a healthy bone density.

   - Debunking the Myth of Full Reversibility | Medication and Pharmaceuticals - A Double-Edged Sword |
     Exploring New Approaches - Exercise and Osteogenic Loading | Conclusion
   - Many individuals utilizing osteogenic loading have seen their bone density improve. It has gone from osteoporosis to osteopenia (low bone density) and in some cases even improve all the way to having healthy bone density.

   - 3m09s: some of that evidence shows benefits from some types of exercise but not from other types of exercise.
     I think an important thing to bear in mind is that the studies haven't shown the exercise alone is going
     to take you from being osteoporotic, having an osteoporotic BMD right up to being normal. So it can have
     a benefit, but a modest benefit for some types of exercise.
   - 4m55s: if you're inactive, you're likely to lose bone and by increasing the activity then some types
     of exercise can increase the bone density.

# Osteoporosis and playing golf

The two most common views are *avoid playing golf* and *modify your swing and behaviour* while playing golf.

   - At 0m59s-1m42s he claims people can be too conservative and avoid exercise to *prevent fractures* at the expense of performing exercise which *reverses osteoporosis*
   - At 6m18s-7m27s he discusses golf

   - ... golf may improve bone density of the lower spine in people taking hormone replacement therapy (Eser, 2008) [see Eser link below]
   - the twisting, bending, and reaching common in [golf] can put added pressure on the spine and could lead to a spinal fracture or
     fracture in other bones if proper body mechanics are not utilized

   - At 4m26s-5m12s they say *Exercises like swimming, gardening, golf and tai chi will help you maintain your muscle
     strength and your balance and coordination and reduce your risk of falling*

       must be critically evaluated before participation is begun. Specifically, studies are needed ... In the interim, physicians may want to
       caution patients with osteoporosis about playing golf.*
