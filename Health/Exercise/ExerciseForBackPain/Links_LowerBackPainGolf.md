     * To initiate core control correctly, diaphragmatic breathing, pelvic tilting (progressing from supine
       to quadruped to standing), pelvic floor exercises, and neurodevelopmental rolling techniques are
       recommended to activate and train the core. These start after the acute pain phase of injury.
