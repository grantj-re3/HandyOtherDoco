# How to create a sleep schedule for a regular-hours shift worker

Having a sleep schedule might not fix insomnia, however you may not be
able to fix your insomnia problems without one. In other words, it may
be a prerequisite to fixing your insomnia problems.

To have a regular sleep schedule, you probably need to find a schedule
for most or all of the activities in your whole week. I suggest a method
below.

## Objective

To find a sleep schedule which fits in with your own circumstances
including, time for family, friends, exercise, etc.

This method should be suitable for those who perform **shift work** at
at the **same hours** each workday (e.g. 1:00 - 9:00 Monday to Friday).

## Method

1. List all *fundamental* activities which you do each week.
1. Divide those activities into 3 categories:
   - Important but immovable. That is, we have little or no control over
     the scheduling of the activity. E.g. Attending work or school.
   - Important but movable. E.g. Sleep time or time spent with family
     and friends.
   - Fundamental but less important activities. E.g. Meals, shopping
     and exercise.
1. Create a schedule by assigning start/end times (and days of the week)
   as follows:
   - assign activities from the "Important but immovable" list first
   - fit in activities from the "Important but movable" list next
   - finally fit in activities from the "Fundamental but less
     important" list
1. Repeat any or all steps in the above method to see if you can
   resolve any scheduling conflicts or improve the schedule.

Like all scheduling problems, this method is not guaranteed to work.
For example, if you have conflicting schedules in the "Important but
immovable" category then you need to find a solution outside of the
scope of this discussion. (You will probably need to move or remove 
one of the conflicting activities or purchase a time machine.)

## Example

1. List of weekly *fundamental* activities:
   - Sleep
   - Family/friends socialisation
   - Work
   - Meals
   - Shopping
   - Exercise
1. Divide those activities into 3 categories:
   - Important but immovable:
     + Work
   - Important but movable:
     + Family/friends socialisation
     + Sleep
   - Fundamental but less important activities:
     + Meals
     + Shopping
     + Exercise
1. Create a schedule:

**Question:** What will you do with your free time, Sun,Mon 1:00-7:30
(that is on the days you don't work)?

**Answer:** Perhaps you need to find some solitary recreational
activity (such as reading, a hobby, study, etc.) and perhaps a
chance to catch up on household bills, paperwork and chores.
