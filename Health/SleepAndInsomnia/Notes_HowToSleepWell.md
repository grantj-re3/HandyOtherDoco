## with Michael Mosley

Documentary, BBC, 2022

# Selected Notes

This documentary was very interesting and contained information
about latest knowledge, technology and some experiments and
demonstrations. However the notes below largely omit this info
and focuses on general information, risks and tips.


## General

- Recommended sleep duration for an adult is 7-9 hours
- Sleep consists of 4 stages, which are repeated
- More than 30 minutes awake is considered to be a problem
- Two types of insomnia:
  * getting to sleep
  * staying asleep (called maintenance insomnia)


## Risks associated with [long term] poor sleep

- Cardiovascular disease [associated with the heart and blood vessels]
- Metabolic dysfunction [which causes the body to have too much or too
  little of the substances regarded as essential]
- Cancer [where abnormal cells grow uncontrollably]
- Excess hunger
- Increased perception of pain
- Brain fog
- Poorer mood / grumpiness
- Poorer physical coordination
- Poorer mental coordination (e.g. reaction time)
- Microsleeps [potentially hazardous when driving or operating certain machinery/tools]
- Performance similar to 2-3 pints of beer
- Higher stress
- Mitochondrial dysfunction which is associated with Alzheimer's disease
- Bad effect on the immune system
- Increased weight gain and obesity
- Type 2 diabetes


## Obstructive sleep apnea

A condition which causes one to repeatedly stop and start breathing while asleep.

Risks:

- Hypertension [high blood pressure]
- Heart disease
- Stroke


## Actions / tips

- Improve sleep routine by:
  * avoid screen use late at night
  * avoid snacks late at night
  * go to bed and get up at about the same time every day
  * Morning: go outside into the morning light
  * Morning: exercise
- General: decluttering bedroom [clutter is a potential source of conscious
  or unconscious stress before bed]
- General: ensure bedroom is dark, cool and quiet
- General: reduce calorie intake
- General: consider the ***quarter of an hour rule*** - if awake for 15 minutes
  then get up and do something else; go to bed when sleepy again; you might
  need to do this several times in one night

Napping during the day:

- About 30 minutes is optimal
- During the 1pm to 4pm window is ideal
- Short ("power") napping can:
  * lift mood
  * improve concentration and creativity
- It is a behaviour which can be learnt
- It gives you practice at falling asleep
