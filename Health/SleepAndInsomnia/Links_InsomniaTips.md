# Tips to deal with insomnia - links

Insomnia is a sleep disorder which:

- makes it difficult to fall asleep, or
- makes it difficult to stay asleep, or
- makes the sufferer wake up too early

In my case insomnia appears to frequently be associated with:

- summertime (I suspect temperature rather than light), or
- sometimes "restless back" (similar to restless legs syndrome)
