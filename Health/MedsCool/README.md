## Action Potentials in neurons and muscle cells

   - [Neurons and Their Role in the Nervous System | 2006-2023](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-neuron-2794890)
   - [All-or-None Law for Nerves and Muscles | 2011-2022](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-all-or-none-law-2794808)
     * The action potential is always a full response. There is no such thing as a "strong" or "weak" action potential.
     * A strong stimulus will cause the neuron to fire much faster than a weak one.
     * It is not the action potential that conveys the strength or intensity of a signal, but rather the speed and number of neurons firing simultaneously.

## The heart and circulatory system

The heart is two pumps, that is blood enters and exits the heart twice.

### More details

1. [Thomas Schwenke | How the Heart Works (Animation) (video) | 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7XLal4Cm1U)
   - Like other organs, the heart itself needs oxygenated blood which is delivered via two coronary arteries
   - "A heart attack can occur when the coronary arteries become blocked narrowed or completely obstructed. Blood
     can then no longer flow freely and oxygen and other nutrients cannot reach the heart."
