# Quiz 1: COVID-19 Physical Distancing

A maths quiz inspired by the new relaxed COVID-19 rules in South Australia
and Western Australia which permit a density of 1 person every 2 square
metres yet still want you to maintain a distance of 1.5m from others. For
details, see the references section.


## Introduction

Consider a large room with lines marked on the floor such that the
floor is divided into *a grid of squares* (i.e. the grid is
formed by intersecting, straight, vertical and horizontal lines).
At the center of each square is a person (represented by a point).


## Questions

1. If the area of each square is 4 square metres, how far is each
   person from their nearest neighbour?

2. If the area of each square is 2 square metres, how far is each
   person from their nearest neighbour? [Hint: In this scenario
   we are already violating the 1.5m distance rule... even for
   infinitely thin people, i.e. points!]

3. For the arrangement/layout given in the introduction, what is
   the area (in square metres) of each square if you require each
   person to be 1.5m from their nearest neighbour?

4. Bonus question: If you have a requirement that a large number
   of points must be spaced 1.5m or more apart, can you find any
   arrangement/layout of those points such that the average
   *area-per-person* is 2 square metres or less?
